# SmartCSV.fx
##Description
A simple JavaFX application to load, save and edit a CSV file and provide a JSON configuration for columns to check the values in the columns.

##Motivation
At work I have the need to fix wrong CSV files from customers. It is hard to find the errors and fix them in a texteditor, 
even in a "normal" CSV editor. So I decided to write this simple JavaFX application.
